# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Tiling

- Restarting restores saved layout order, split ratios, fullscreen state and floating frames for surviving windows, including windows returned to their original Spaces on quit. Deleted Spaces use the saved workspace number when a replacement is available. Inactive Spaces restore on their next visit. Current rules and layout settings take precedence.

### Fixes

- Quitting, disabling, and explicit recovery return windows to surviving original native Spaces. A window whose original Space was deleted stays on its current Space. Untiled frames are restored within the destination monitor. Inaccessible or failed restores remain available for an explicit later attempt.

## 0.15

### Tiling

- New windows open on the focused display, unless a rule moves them.

### Fixes

- An empty workspace activates Finder, even with the desktop turned off, so typing no longer goes to an app on another workspace.

## 0.14

### Install

- The Homebrew cask installs on macOS 15 or later, as the app supports. Before, it asked for a newer macOS.

### Command line

- `dinky -v` prints the version, like `dinky version` and `dinky --version`.

### Fixes

- Switching to an empty workspace keeps focus on its display. Before, macOS could hand focus to a window on another display, so typing and the next `workspace next` went there. `focus-monitor` onto an empty display also takes the keyboard off the other display's window.

## 0.13

### Tiling

- Windows that can't go full screen float on their own, like Finder's copy progress window, About This Mac and Calculator. Terminals and editors that can hide their title bar still tile. Set `float-windows-without-fullscreen = false` to tile them as before, or tile a single app with a `layout tiling` rule.

## 0.12

### Fixes

- Cmd-Tab to an app on another workspace brings that app's window to the front when you get there. Before, another app could stay in front, and for an app with windows on several workspaces dinky could go to the wrong one.

## 0.11

### Fixes

- Obsidian and other Electron apps tile again. Their windows could keep a slot in the layout while staying where they were, with other windows tiling around the empty slot.

## 0.10

### Scripting

- `dinky list-modes --current` prints the binding mode dinky is in, and `mode-changed` hooks get `$DINKY_MODE` and `$DINKY_PREV_MODE`, so a bar can show the mode.

### Menu

- Clear Saved Minimum Sizes in the menu, or `dinky clear-minimum-sizes`, forgets the minimum window sizes dinky has learned for each app, so windows can tile smaller again after an app lowers its minimum.

## 0.9

### Menu

- The menu bar menu has every command: focus, move, join, resize, layout, displays and modes as well as workspaces. Each item shows the key bound to it, and bindings no item covers are listed under Other Key Bindings.

## 0.8

### Fixes

- Sleeping and waking, or anything else that makes displays drop out and come back, no longer piles other workspaces' windows onto workspace 1. Once the displays settle, each window goes back to its workspace.
- After displays come or go, windows that apps moved around on hidden workspaces snap straight back into their tiles when you next visit, instead of gliding in from wherever the app put them.
- `workspace prev` and `workspace next` no longer get stuck on a display with nothing on it. A display focused with `focus-monitor` or `focus --boundaries all-monitors-outer-frame` stops counting as focused once dinky focuses a window or a display comes or goes, even when that window had focus before.

## 0.7

### Fixes

- Unplugging the display dinky was animating on no longer leaves windows stuck mid-glide at odd sizes. Animations continue on the display that is main now, and a glide that stalls for any other reason lands its windows within a couple of seconds.

## 0.6

### Motion

- Windows take about 150 ms to glide to their tiles by default, up from 50. Set `[animations] duration-ms` to change it.

### Fixes

- The minimum sizes dinky learns for an app are kept across quits and `enable off`; restoring windows no longer overwrites them with the ones from launch.
- A new window that reuses a closed window's id is tiled instead of being left where it opened.
- When macOS moves a display's Spaces to another display, their layouts move with them instead of starting over.
- A minimized window keeps its border, hidden, instead of getting a new one when it comes back.
- `move-window-to-display --follow` focuses the moved window as reliably as `move-window-to-workspace --follow` does, instead of sometimes leaving the layout behind on the old window.
- `dinky help` says what `enable off` does: it stops tiling and restores every window.

## 0.5

### Motion

- Windows glide to their tiles instead of jumping. Set the speed with `[animations] duration-ms` (50 by default) or turn it off with `enabled = false`. It's off while macOS's Reduce Motion is on.
- While you drag a tiled window, dinky outlines the tile it came from and the tile it will swap with. The window now swaps with the tile under the pointer, not the one under its centre. `[drag] placeholders = false` turns the outlines off.

### Layouts

- `flatten-workspace-tree` puts windows back into the workspace's configured layout: a fixed grid gets its cells back, and an accordion workspace becomes an accordion again.
- `move` past the edge of an accordion that fills the workspace takes the window out of it, into a tile beside the accordion, as in AeroSpace.

### Other

- dinky warns when another window manager is also running, with a `!` in the menu bar, a line in the menu and in `dinky doctor`. Two window managers undo each other's layouts, which looks like dinky failing to tile.
- The update window shows what changed, and every release is listed at [dinky.rodeo/changelog](https://dinky.rodeo/changelog/).

### Fixes

- Clicking between two windows of the same app moves focus and the border to the window you clicked.
- A window put into native full screen, or slow to finish a resize, no longer teaches dinky that its app can't shrink. That could leave every window of the app filling the screen.

## 0.4

**Upgrading:** workspaces are now numbered across all displays. `workspaces` is the total rather than a count per display, and `workspaces` inside `[display.<pattern>]` is now a config error. Use `[workspace-to-display]` to put a workspace on a particular display.

### Workspaces

- Workspace numbers stay put when you dock or undock. Each workspace is one Space, on the main display unless `[workspace-to-display]` places it elsewhere.
- dinky removes Spaces it no longer needs instead of letting leftovers pile up.
- Tiled windows keep their layout when their workspace moves to another display.
- `workspace N` goes to whichever display the workspace is on; `workspace prev` and `next` step through the focused display's workspaces.
- Queries, hooks and the menu bar use the new global numbers.

### Layouts

- New `fixed` layout: give a workspace a grid with `[workspace.N]` `columns` and `rows`. New windows fill empty cells without resizing the others; when the grid is full, `expand` adds a column, adds a row, or stacks windows in the last cell.
- `default-tiling = false` leaves workspaces untiled unless a `[workspace.N]` table turns tiling on.
- `dwindle` is accepted as another name for the `tiles` layout.

### Fixes

- Cmd-Tab to Helium and Safari web apps switches Spaces again.
- `workspace-back-and-forth` returns to the workspace you were on, not a Space you swiped past.
